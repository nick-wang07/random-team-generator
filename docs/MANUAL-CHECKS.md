# Manual checks

## Setup view

- [x] Adding a name puts it in the list and clears the input.
- [x] Adding the same name in different case shows "already on the roster".
- [x] Adding only whitespace shows "Name cannot be empty".
- [x] Rename works; cancelling the prompt changes nothing.
- [x] Removing a checked person leaves no ghost check-off behind.
- [x] Two people checked with Teams at 2 enables both start buttons.
- [x] Teams at 3 with two people checked disables them and reads
      "Need at least 3 people for 3 teams".
- [x] Refreshing restores the roster, the check-offs, and the team count.
